# open_binmat

`open.binmat` is a fully functional binmat implementation that allows playing binmat in-game without fees.
The initial board state and any other random events are determined by a seed that can be set before the game.
It also allows for users to join a game multiple times (with the correct setting applied) allowing for testing agains yourself.

### roadmap

Planned future features include binmat-brain support for testing, a provided binmat bot to play against, customizable buy-ins and more!
